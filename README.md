We developed a graph-based approach to identify complex connections in heterogeneous biological networks.
We use data from different omics layers, which we link using : BioPAX, UniProt and ChEBI ontologies.

The SPARQL queries used are available in the jupyter notebook "**2023_06_BioPAX_data-integration.ipyn**".
